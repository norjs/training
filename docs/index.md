### Index

Internet is full of different sources to learn programming. However for a 
beginner it can be overwhelming to find where to start, figure out which 
sources are good quality, how to setup development environment, and even how to 
decide which tools to learn. It is not a straight line. I want to change that.

I intend to write high quality articles and teach everything I know about 
programming on this site. Focus will be on HTML5 web development -- anything 
you might need to work for [NorJS project](http://www.norjs.com).

Because of that I will use the application stack I commonly use, and which is 
compatible with my architecture choises. After all, the point of this site is 
to offer solid and consistent path to learn programming. You can use other 
sources available on the Internet to learn stuff outside of this path.

I will start from the beginner level and move up to more advanced stuff later.

I will plan what I will write using [Github 
issues](https://github.com/norjs/training/issues).

I will publish what I have done at [the blog](/blog.html).
