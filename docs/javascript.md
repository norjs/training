### JavaScript

JavaScript is a popular dynamic programming language. It was originally 
developed for web browsers, but today it can be used in many other environments 
like web servers, database servers, native applications, mobile devices, PDF 
files, SVG images, inside Google documents (eg. Spreadsheets), etc.

Latest standard goes with a name ECMAScript, and this project will actually 
teach ECMAScript version 6.

There are generally only two types of things in JavaScript language: variables 
and operators. Even functions can be though of as a variable.

### Variables

Any variable has a type and a name.

A variable can be:

 * `undefined`
 * `null`
 * `true` or `false`, eg type of `Boolean`
 * `123.456`, eg type of `Number`
 * `"hello"` eg type of `String`
 * `(a, b) => a+b`, eg. type of a `Function`
 * User defined object (see classes)
 * Symbol (see Symbols)

### Functions

Functions are actually objects. It also means functions can have user defined properties.
