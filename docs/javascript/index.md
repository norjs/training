### JavaScript

JavaScript is a popular dynamic programming language. It was originally 
developed for web browsers, but today it can be used in many other environments 
like web servers, database servers, native applications, mobile devices, PDF 
files, SVG images, inside Google documents (eg. Spreadsheets), etc.

Latest standard goes with the name ECMAScript, and this site will 
actually teach [ECMAScript version 6](http://es6-features.org/).

There are generally only two types of essential features in JavaScript language 
which actually make things work. These are [variables](./variables.md) and 
[operators](./operators.md). Even functions can be though of as a variable. Of 
course, there is also [comments](./comments.md), etc.

* [Statements](./statements.md)
* [Variables](./variables.md)
* [Operators](./operators.md)
* [Functions](./functions.md)
* [Classes](./classes.md)
* [Symbols](./symbols.md)
